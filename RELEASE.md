# mbedTLS Crypto acceleration for CAT1A, CAT1B & CAT1C MCUs

### What's Included?
Please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) for a complete description of the CAT1A, CAT1B & CAT1C acceleration for mbedTLS library.
New in this release:

* Added crypto HAL resource allocation check.

### Limitations
Currently Cypress CAT1A & CAT1C acceleration doesn't support:

- RSA
- ECP NIST-B curves
- ECP NIST-K curves
- ECP 25519 curve
- CHACHA20
- SHA3
- POLY1305

Currently Cypress CAT1B acceleration supports only

-SHA256
