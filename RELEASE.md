# mbedTLS Crypto acceleration for CAT1A,CAT1B and CAT1C  MCUs

### What's Included?
Please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) for a complete description of the CAT1A, CAT1B and CAT1C acceleration for mbedTLS library.
New in this release:

* Support for CAT1B and CAT1C MCUs

### Limitations
Currently Cypress CAT1A and CAT1C acceleration doesn't support:

- RSA
- ECP NIST-B curves
- ECP NIST-K curves
- ECP 25519 curve
- Montgomery Curve for ECDH
- CHACHA20
- SHA3
- AES GCM
- POLY1305

Currently Cypress CAT1B acceleration doesn't support:

- RSA
- ECC curves, ECDSA, ECDH
- AES
